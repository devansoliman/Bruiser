## Assembly
> [!NOTE]  
> Prepare all protective equipment before starting.

1. Sand all surfaces of the board until rough.

2. Assemble the printed parts in the following order: `nose` (1), `front bridge` (2), `rear bridge` (3), `tail` (4). Use the `link`s to connect the four sections. Reduce the gap between the parts as much as possible.

4. Sand as necessary to reduce unevenness at the seams.

5. Pick a side (top or bottom) to begin the carbon fiber layup. On the opposite side, cover seams and gaps with duct tape. This will prevent resin from pouring through.

6. Mix ~60 mL resin and hardener in a disposable cup and use the brush to evenly coat one side of the board. For the base coat, make sure resin fills the gaps between the parts. 

7. Lay down a sheet of carbon fiber over the board. Orient as many fibers as possible to run parallel to the board. Push down with a roller to remove bubbles and encourage the resin to permeate the fabric.

8. Repeat steps **6 and 7** twice. On the second layer, orient the fabric diagonally by 45 degrees to increase the layup's quasi-isotropic strength.

9. Give the board a top coat of resin and hardener. You may need more than usual to permeate the carbon fiber and achieve a smooth finish (~75 mL). You can use a lighter or heat gun to remove bubbles.

10. Allow to cure completely.

11. Trim away unhardened carbon fiber with scissors. This will leave an overhang of hardended carbon fiber that can catch resin runoff on the next layup and help encase the printed core.

12. Drill the hardware holes.

> [!CAUTION]
> At this point, hardened carbon fiber can create sharp edges and points. Use protective gloves when handling the board.

13. On the non-reinforced side of the board, remove the duct tape. Cut excess resin with the serrated blade and/or sand it flat. In some cases it may peel/pop right off.

14. Repeat steps **4-12** for the non-reinforced side of the board.

15. Using the serrated blade, saw away the carbon fiber overhang. To reduce the risk of cutting into the board itself, cut carbon fiber overhangs to a sandable size; do not attempt remove completely.

15. Use the sander or sanding block to smooth the rails. Round out the edges to make carrying the board easier.

16. **OPTIONAL**: If there are still flaws in the surface of the board, you can lightly sand the entire board until level and apply a very thin layer of resin (~30 mL).
> [!CAUTION]
> Immediately stop sanding an area if you encounter carbon fiber, indicated by black dust. Remember that some parts of the resin coat may be thicker than others.
