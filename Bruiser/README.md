### Protective Equipment
- disposable gloves
- safety goggles
- respirator
- long sleeves and closed-toe shoes
- well ventilated environment

### Tools
- hex key
- sandpaper/sander
- epoxy brushes
- scissors
- utiliy blade
- drill
- rotary tool (optional)

### Parts
- 2 × `bridge`
- 2 × `tail`
- 6 × M5 socket cap bolts: 50 mm of (preferably coarse) thread
- carbon fiber (enough for 4 layers)
- epoxy resin + hardener

### Printing
Prototype performed well with the following configuration:
- material: **PETG**
- line width: **0.6 mm**
- infill: **20%**
- pattern: **gyroid**
- shells: **2**
- supports: **yes**
- Cura settings: **`Connect Infill Lines`, `Slicing Tolerance: Exclusive`**

### Assembly
1. Sand the mating surfaces of the printed parts until rough. This will increase the available surface area to bond with the resin should any seep through. You may sand the rest of the surfaces now or wait until the board is assembled.

2. Arrange the printed parts as follows: `tail`, `bridge`, `bridge`, `tail`. Make sure the truck mount countersinks are facing up.

3. Add the bolts from rectangular wells in the `bridge`s and slide the through the hole in each well. Apply force and start turning each bolt once it makes contact with a smaller hole in another part. Any gap between `bridge` and `tail` should disappear. Tighten until you encounter significant resistance to reduce risk of cross-threading.

4. If you have not already, sand the upward face, downward face, and the sides of the board.

5. Mix a base coat of resin and hardener and thoroughly coat the first face.

6. Allow the base coat to cure until it is tacky, but not completely hardened. The time you should wait will depend on your resin. Check its state every hour after application.

7. Cut a layer of carbon fiber and lay it onto the coated surface. Leave enough overhang that the layer will be unaffected by strands that will unweave and come loose. Lightly press it down to allow resin to permeate the fiber.

8. You may use scissors to cut the carbon fiber closer to the deck's dimensions now to reduce finishing work later, but you must thoroughly clean the scissors of any epoxy immediately afterwards.

9. Allow the first layer to cure at least until the resin hardens.

**⚠️ At this point, handling the Bruiser is dangerous due to sharp edges/points created by hardened carbon fiber. ⚠️**

10. Repeat steps 5-9 for any additional layers to this face (recommended: 2 total carbon fiber layers). Discard your used brush if it is completely soaked in resin.

11. Mix a top coat and thoroughly coat the first face. Allow all layers to cure completely.

12. Drill the baseplate mounting holes through the carbon fiber layers.

13. You may need to use a blade and/or sandpaper to remove any hardened resin that has dripped off or through the part onto the next face you plan to add carbon fiber.

14. Repeat steps 5-12 for the next face of the skateboard.

15. If the remaining carbon fiber overhang is small, sand it down until there is no sharp edge. Go to step 17. Otherwise, go to step 16.

16. For larger overhangs, use a rotary tool to cut the overhang down. Use a wheel with an abrasive edge, as a wheel with teeth can cause the resin to fracture. Reduce to a sandable size; to reduce the risk of cutting into the board, do not attempt remove completely. Go to step 15.

17. Add a layer of grip tape.
