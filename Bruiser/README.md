# Bruiser
Built to last in tough streets and under tougher riders.

### Specs
- deck length: 32 inches
- reinforcement method: carbon fiber layup, bolts
- difficulty: hard

### Protective Equipment

- well ventilated workspace

### Tools
- hex key
- sandpaper/sander
- epoxy brushes
- scissors
- utility blade
- drill
- rotary tool (optional)

### Parts
- 2 × `bridge`
- 2 × `tail`
- 6 × M5 socket cap bolts: 50 mm of (preferably coarse) thread
- carbon fiber (enough for 4 layers)
- epoxy resin + hardener

### Printing
Prototype performed well with the following configuration:
- material: **PETG**
- line width: **0.6 mm**
- infill: **20%**
- pattern: **gyroid**
- shells: **2**
- supports: **yes**
- Cura settings: **`Connect Infill Lines`, `Slicing Tolerance: Exclusive`**

### Assembly
1. Sand the mating surfaces of the printed parts just until rough. This will increase the available surface area to bond with the resin should any seep through. You may sand the rest of the board now or wait it is assembled.

2. Arrange the printed parts as follows: `tail`, `bridge`, `bridge`, `tail`. Make sure all parts are facing the same direction.

3. Add the bolts from rectangular wells in the `bridge`s and slide the through the hole in each well. Apply force and start turning each bolt once it makes contact with a smaller hole in another part. Any gap between `bridge` and `tail` should disappear. Tighten until you encounter significant resistance to reduce risk of cross-threading.

4. If you have not already, sand the upward face, downward face, and the sides of the board.

5. Mix a base coat of resin and hardener and coat the first face.

6. Allow the base coat to cure until it is tacky, but not completely hardened. The time you should wait will depend on your resin. If unsure, check its state every hour after application.

7. Cut a layer of carbon fiber and lay it onto the coated surface. Leave enough overhang that the layer will be unaffected by strands that will unweave and come loose. Lightly press it down to allow resin to permeate the fiber.

8. You may use scissors to cut the carbon fiber closer to the deck's dimensions now to reduce finishing work later. Thoroughly clean the scissors of any epoxy immediately afterwards.

9. Allow the first layer to cure at least until the resin hardens. **⚠️ At this point, handling the Bruiser is dangerous due to sharp edges/points created by hardened carbon fiber. ⚠️** Now is another opportunity to cut excess fiber, if you choose.

10. Repeat steps **5-9** for any additional layers to this face (recommended: **repeat once**). Apply each carbon fiber layer with a 45-degree rotational offset from the previous layer to ensure strength in all directions. Discard your used brush if it is completely soaked in resin.

11. Mix a top coat and coat the first face. Allow all layers to cure completely.

12. Drill the baseplate mounting holes through the carbon fiber layers.

13. Use a blade and/or sandpaper to remove any hardened resin that has dripped off or through the part onto the next face you plan to add carbon fiber.

14. Repeat steps **5-12** for the opposite face of the skateboard.

15. If the remaining carbon fiber overhang is small, sand it down until there is no sharp edge, and skip step 16. Otherwise, continue to step 16.

16. For larger overhangs, use a rotary tool to cut the overhang down. Use a wheel with an abrasive edge, as a wheel with teeth can cause the resin to fracture. Reduce to a sandable size; to reduce the risk of cutting into the board, do not attempt remove completely. Go to step 15.

17. Sand all surfaces of the board just until rough. Immediately stop sanding an area if you encounter carbon fiber, indicated by black dust as a result of sanding. Remember that some parts of the resin coating may be thicker than others.

18. Apply an additional coat of resin and hardener on the entire board. Allow to cure completely. Cut or sand any resin runoff.

19. Add a layer of grip tape.
