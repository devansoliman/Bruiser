## Casting
1. Use a soldering iron to melt the threaded inserts into the 4 circular holes on the underside of the core.
2. Sand away excess material from the brim and heat-setting.
3. Sand down layer lines as necessary on the `sidewall` and `uppermold`. Clean mold.
4. Apply multiple coats of mold release or a very thin layer of petroleum jelly to the mold surfaces facing the pour. Layer lines should now only be barely visible.
5. Assemble the mold: bolt the `core` to the `lower mold` using the M4 inserts, seat the `upper mold` above the `core` and secure with an M5 bolt and nut. Bolt the `sidewall` using the remaining M5 bolts and nuts.
6. Set the assembled mold on a level surface. 
7. Measure and mark **180 mL** and **360 mL** on the disposable cup.
8. Mix **360 mL** total of urethane and hardener in the cup. If you choose, you can also mix in the pigment to color your finished wheels.
> [!TIP]
> To account for urethane that seeps through small gaps in the mold or is hard to get out of the cup, you can mix **400 mL** of urethane after marking 200 mL and 400 mL on the cup instead.
9. Pour the mixture into the mold. Allow to cure.
10. Unbolt the mold assembly.
11. Use the screwdrivers to separate the `lower mold` and `upper mold`. Use the chamfered sections of the `sidewall` and the lip of the `upper mold` to pry them apart.
12. Wedge a screwdriver between the wheel and the `sidewall`. You should hear the urethane peel from the mold. Repeat in a circular pattern and on the opposite side of the wheel. Be careful not to cut into the urethane.
13. Insert one of the bearings. Add the spacer. Insert the second bearing.
> [!TIP]
> You can use the axle of a truck to align the bearings and spacer as you press them in.
