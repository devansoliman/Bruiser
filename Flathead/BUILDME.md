### Parts
- 1 × steel rod: 9.525 mm (0.375 in) diameter, 450 mm length
- 1 × `bridge`
- 2 × `endpiece`
- 4 × M6 socket cap bolts: 30 mm transitions, 32 mm of (preferably coarse) thread

### Printing
Version `0.1` performed well with the following configuration:
- material: **PETG**
- line width: **0.4 mm**
- infill: 10% for `bridge`, 15% for `endpiece`s (for better durability, I recommend at least **20%** for the entire board)
- pattern: **triangular**
- shells: **6**
- supports: **none**

### Assembly
1. Fit the steel rod through `bridge`. The midpoint of the rod should be at the center of `bridge`.
2. Add `endpiece`s to either side of `bridge`. Make sure the truck mount countersinks are facing up. Try to minimize the gap between the three pieces. If a small gap remains, it can be fixed in step 3.
3. Add the bolts from rectangular slots in `bridge`. Start turning each bolt once the threads enter an `endpiece`. Any gap between `bridge` and `endpiece` should disappear. Tighten until you encounter significant resistance to reduce risk of cross-threading.
4. Add a layer of grip tape.
