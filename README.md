# Bruiser
3D-printable skateboards. Ride at your own risk.

## Development
[Releases](https://github.com/DevanSoliman/Bruiser/releases) will consist of board designs that can withstand immediate post-production strength tests and small updates to those designs. The most current design will always be available in `Code`, but likely not ready to manufacture.

## Making
A printing guide, parts list, and assembly instructions can be found with each release. This information will change between versions, and parts are not backwards compatible.
