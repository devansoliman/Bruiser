# Bruiser
A 3D-printable skateboard. Ride at your own risk.

## Development
[Releases](https://github.com/DevanSoliman/Bruiser/releases) will consist of board designs that can withstand initial strength tests and small updates to those designs. The most current design will always be available, but likely not ready to manufacture.

## Making
A printing guide, parts list, and assembly instructions can be found with each release. This information will change between versions, and parts are not backwards compatible.
